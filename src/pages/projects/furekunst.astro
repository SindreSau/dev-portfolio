            <h2 class="">Contentful Integration with Next.js</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The site integrates Contentful as a headless CMS with Next.js, using
            the Contentful Delivery API to retrieve and present artwork data.
            The content model features a GalleryPost type, enabling the artist
            to upload and manage their artwork entries, and a linked
            SizeAndPrice model. This setup supports conditional rendering of
            multiple size and price options when an artwork is categorized as a
            "Print" instead of an "Original".
        </p>

        <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
            <IconGrid class="size-8 text-primary translate-y-1" />
            <h2>Masonry Gallery Layout</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The gallery implements react-masonry-css to create a responsive,
            Pinterest-style grid that adapts to various screen sizes and
            gracefully handles artworks of different dimensions. The layout
            automatically adjusts its column count based on viewport width,
            maintaining visual harmony while maximizing screen usage across
            devices, from three columns on larger displays down to a single
            column on mobile.
        </p>

            <IconFrame class="size-8 text-primary translate-y-1" />
            <h2>CSS Frame Effects</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            One distinctive feature is the realistic picture frame effect
            created entirely with CSS, giving digital artwork a physical gallery
            presence. The implementation uses layered shadows, borders, and
            gradient overlays to simulate frame depth, with an optional
            passepartout (mat board) effect toggled directly by the artistd
            through Contentful's content model. This attention to presentation
            details elevates the viewing experience, creating a sense of depth
            and physicality that's often lacking in digital galleries.

        <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
            <IconImageOptimize class="size-8 text-primary translate-y-1" />
            <h2>Next.js Image Optimization</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The site leverages Next.js's Image component for comprehensive
            optimization, delivering responsive images in modern formats like
            WebP and AVIF while reducing bundle size. Images load progressively
            with smooth fade-in transitions, use appropriate sizing based on
            viewport, and implement strategic loading priorities where
            above-fold content appears first. The integration with Contentful's
            image API allows for additional optimization through URL parameters,
            enabling resizing and format adjustments directly from the CDN.
        </p>

            <IconSparkles class="size-8 text-primary translate-y-1" />
            <h2>Motion Animations</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The site implements Motion (formerly Framer Motion) for subtle
            animations that enhance the viewing experience without overwhelming
            the artwork itself. Staggered reveal effects create visual rhythm as
            users scroll through the gallery, while subtle hover states provide
            feedback without distracting from the art. The implementation
            staggers animation timing based on each item's index, creating a
            cascade effect as content appears on the page, all while respecting
            user preferences for reduced motion.
