        <h2>Case</h2>
        <p>
            Accenture's Bachelor Application Challenge Accenture faced a
            time-consuming manual process for managing bachelor thesis
            applications. Staff manually extracted student information from
            scattered emails, downloaded and re-uploaded CVs and transcripts to
            shared folders, and managed communications individually. This
            inefficient workflow created administrative burden and uncertainty
            for applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution: a dual-application system featuring a student-facing
            portal for streamlined applications and an admin dashboard for
            centralized management. The platform automates document handling,
            enables collaborative review processes, ensures GDPR compliance, and
            provides immediate confirmation to students. Built with Next.js,
            TypeScript, and secure cloud infrastructure, the system transforms
            hundreds of manual email interactions into an efficient,
            professional digital workflow.

        <h2>Admin Dashboard</h2>

        <p>
            This project involved creating a comprehensive admin dashboard for
            Accenture to streamline their bachelor application process. It
            replaced a cumbersome email-based system with a secure,
            collaborative platform.
